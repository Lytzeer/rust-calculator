# RUST CALCULATOR

## Rust Calculator is currently my biggest project. I have never done a project of this size before. The goal of this project is to have a help for the Rust game, to know what resources is needed to make a craft, where to find a certain item in the game with its droprate, and a cost raid calculator. The project will be coded in Golang
## This project will be done :
- In CLI
- Adapt to website
- Adapt in Discord Bot
